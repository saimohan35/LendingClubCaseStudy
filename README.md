# Lending Club Case Study 
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures.
Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

When the company receives a loan application, the company must decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
